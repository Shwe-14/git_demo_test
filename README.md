A new Flutter application.

## Making Contribution

### Step 1: Git Clone  

Clone the repository into your local machine using HTTPS or SSH.

`git clone git@github.com:Shwe-14/git_demo_test.git`

<img alt="git clone ssh" src="git_clone.png" width="600">  

### Step 2:  Git Status/ Add/ Commit  

Before creating a new branch, you have to do the following steps.  
1. `git status` (to see the changes.)  
<img alt="git clone ssh" src="git_status.png" width="600">  

2. `git add .`  (to add the changes to a stage.)  
<img alt="git clone ssh" src="git_add.png" width="500">  

3. `git commit -m "commit_message"`  (to confirm the changes with a commit message.)  
<img alt="git clone ssh" src="git_commit.png" width="700">  

### Step 3:  Git Branch  

Create a branch. Give the branch name something related to the feature you will work on or a bug supposed to be fixed. For example, `user_login_screen` or `login_error_fix`.  

`git checkout -b "branch_name"`
